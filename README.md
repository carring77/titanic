Trying out GitHub with Titanic Kaggle competition

First try was a simple logistic with only the fields that popped as significant.
I also created an age range factor and used that instead of age.
In future, it might be good to try to impute the missing values for age and use it as-is.

Accuracy on public test set was 0.74641.
